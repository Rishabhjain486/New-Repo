4. Jumping to the beginning or the end of the line: `home` & `end` keys on windows, `cmd + left/ right arrows` on mac

## VS Code specific keyboard shortcuts

1. When you `siingle click` on the files one after another, they open and then get replaced by the next file we clicked. But if we `double click` then these files stay open.

2. To open the settings: `ctrl + ,` or `cmd + ,`

3. To Toggle comments on/ off: `ctrl + /` or `cmd + /`

4. If you want go to next line when cursor is in middle of a word/ sentence: `ctrl + Enter` or `cmd + Enter`

5. To copy the whole line (or multiple lines selected): `shift + alt + down arrow` or `shift + opt + down arrow`

6. To move a text line to a different line number: hold `alt/ opt + up/ down arrows`

7. Use `ctrl + d` or `cmd + d` to selected the next instance of text with same name. For example we need to select "xyz" in three lines and replace it with "abc" - select "xyz" then press `ctrl + d` or `cmd + d` to select the next instances of "xyz" and now we can replace all these instances with "abc" at the same time

8. DevTools in Chrome: 
   To open - `F12` or `opt + cmd + i`
   TO resize - `ctrl +/-` or `cmd +/-`

9. 



## HTML specific shortcuts:

1. Change `Tab size` in the settings from 4 to 2. Then the HTML would not spread out too much.

2. With Emmet, we do not have to type `<>` for the tags. Just write the tag name and hit `Enter` and Emmet will complete the syntax with the opening and closing tag both.

3. Home page is always called the Index page and thus file name should be `index.html`.

4. HTML comments `<!-- -->` are multi line too

5. Use Emmet to generate the HTML structure: type `!` and press `Enter`

6. To generate dummy text: type `lorem` and hit `Enter`
   If we want to specify the number of words (say 10 words): `lorem10`

7. If we want 4 list tags, instead of typing out `li` four times, type `li*4` and hit `Enter` - we will get 4 list tags

8. In forms, `input:xyz` will create `input` tag with `type` attribute as `xyz`

9. To enter tags with `id` attribute: `tagname#idvalue`. For example `h1#main` creates `h1` tag with `id` value as "main"
   To enter tags with `class` attribute: `tagname.classvalue`. For example `h3.main` creates `h3` tag with `class` value as "main"
   To enter tags with `class` & `id` attributes together: `tagname#idvalue.classvalue`. For example `h3#title.card` creates `h3` tag with `id` value as "title" and `class` value as "card"

10. Divs: `#xyz` will create a `div` with `id` as "xyz"
          `.abc` will create a `div` with `class` as "abc"
          `#xyz.abc` will create a `div` with `id` as "xyz" & `class` as "abc"
