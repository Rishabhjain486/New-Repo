# VS Code Tricks and Keyboard Shortcuts

## General shortcuts:

1. When you `siingle click` on the files one after another, they open and then get replaced by the next file we clicked. But if we `double click` then these files stay open.

2. To open the settings: `ctrl + ,` or `cmd + ,`

3. To Toggle comments on/ off: `ctrl + /` or `cmd + /`

4. If you want go to next line when cursor is in middle of a word/ sentence: `ctrl + Enter` or `cmd + Enter`

## HTML specific shortcuts:

1. Change `Tab size` in the settings from 4 to 2. Then the HTML would not spread out too much.

2. With Emmet, we do not have to type `<>` for the tags. Just write the tag name and hit `Enter` and Emmet will complete the syntax with the opening and closing tag both.

3. Home page is always called the Index page and thus file name should be `index.html`.

4. HTML comments `<!-- -->` are multi line too

5. Use Emmet to generate the HTML structure: type `!` and press `Enter`

6. To generate dummy text: type `lorem` and hit Enter
   If we want to specify the number of words (say 10 words): `lorem10`
